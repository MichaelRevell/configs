13:03:33[19:37:42] <&alnewkirk       > sweet
13:03:33[19:37:47] <&alnewkirk       > I commented
13:03:33[19:37:52] <&alnewkirk       > incoming ...
13:03:33[19:38:02] <&alnewkirk       > Okay, so this first query is getting all user contributions in the last month regardless of campaign, and the cont_rset routine is on the campaign result object. So I could've pulled the code in that routine out, or duplicated it somewhere else, either way it would've been duplicated, or double the effort to abstract it away and refactor all the code that uses it. ... and because I am duplicating here, I just decided to do the same in the next query so at-least its uniform.
13:03:33[19:38:45] <&ironcamel       > but you are not actually duplicating the same logic
13:03:33[19:38:50] <&ironcamel       > your logic is actually different
13:03:33[19:38:54] <&ironcamel       > that was my concern
13:03:33[19:40:11] <&ironcamel       > also, it would have taken no effort to use cont_rset() itself, since as you know, you can chain resultset methods
13:03:33[19:40:15] <&alnewkirk       > yeah, true, which brings me to your initial question
13:03:33[19:40:24] <&alnewkirk       > the decision was based on this hash map
13:03:33[19:40:28] <&alnewkirk       >     my $status_map = {

13:03:33[19:40:31] <&ironcamel       > the only reason not to, is if you actually needed the different logic
13:03:33[19:41:19] <&alnewkirk       > how does chaining come into play?
13:03:33[19:42:35] <&ironcamel       > for example, you are doing, +            my $amounts = $campaign->contributions->search({
13:03:33[19:42:35] <&ironcamel       > +                user_id => $user_id,

13:03:33[19:43:02] <&ironcamel       > that could be $campaign->cont_rset->({ user_id => $user_id });
13:03:33[19:43:07] <&ironcamel       > right?
13:03:33[19:44:01] <&alnewkirk       > right, but as I said earlier, since that didn't apply to the first query, I didn't apply it to the query you referenced
13:03:33[19:44:44] <&ironcamel       > you are saying that you on purpose did different logic than what is in cont_rset right?
13:03:33[19:45:13] <&ironcamel       > can you explain to me how you came up with the new logic
13:03:33[19:45:38] <&alnewkirk       > yes ... and yes
13:03:33[19:46:55] <&alnewkirk       > using the status map defined in the contribution result object, I created a query for all positive contirbutions
13:03:33[19:50:35] <&ironcamel       > i believe that is also the goal of the cont_rset() method
13:03:33[19:50:50] <&alnewkirk       > ...
13:03:33[19:51:06] <&alnewkirk       > brb
13:03:33[19:51:52] <&alnewkirk       > so cont_rset queries for (-not_in => [qw(preauth_accepted preauth_refunded postauth_refunded)]) ...
13:03:33[19:52:00] <&ironcamel       > yeah :/
13:03:33[19:52:04] <&ironcamel       > i kinda like your way better
13:03:33[19:52:26] <&alnewkirk       > which kinda suggests that postauth_rejected, ???_rejected, etc could be returned also
13:03:33[19:52:40] <&ironcamel       > well, the reason that the cont_rset logic may still be correct
13:03:33[19:52:50] <&ironcamel       > is if those status are no longer valid statuses
13:03:33[19:53:00] <&ironcamel       > we used to have a different payment processor, called poundpay
13:03:33[19:53:09] <&ironcamel       > and some of the status we used then, we no longer use
13:03:33[19:53:17] <&alnewkirk       > ... not to mention, a status of preauth_accepted, seems valid in the query I'm trtying to construct
13:03:33[19:53:35] <&ironcamel       > again, preauth_accepted does not exist anymore i believe
13:03:33[19:53:44] <&ironcamel       > it is not even in that hash map that you pasted
13:03:33[19:53:52] <&alnewkirk       > is there a master list of possible statuses?
13:03:33[19:53:56] <&ironcamel       > yes
13:03:33[19:54:06] <&ironcamel       > select distinct status from contributions;
13:03:33[19:54:07] <&alnewkirk       > but it is in the cont_rset criteria
13:03:33[19:54:23] <&ironcamel       > yeah
13:03:33[19:54:41] <&alnewkirk       > ironcamel: that just shows whats in the database at the time, not what possibilities there are
13:03:33[19:54:50] <&ironcamel       > yeah
13:03:33[19:54:59] <&ironcamel       > i don't know what the current possibilities are
13:03:33[19:55:09] <&ironcamel       > not at the time
13:03:33[19:55:14] <&alnewkirk       > me either, so I did the best I could :}
13:03:33[19:55:17] <&ironcamel       > it shows the possibilities of all time
13:03:33[19:55:22] <&alnewkirk       > seemed valid at the time
13:03:33[19:55:28] <&ironcamel       > right
13:03:33[19:55:35] <&ironcamel       > so the best way to do it is to centralize the logic
13:03:33[19:55:40] <&ironcamel       > and use existing logic
13:03:33[19:55:42] <&StoneCypher     > you know what else seemed valid at the time?  disco.
13:03:33[19:55:43] <&alnewkirk       > well ... maybe, if run against the production database

13:14:13<&alnewkirk> I found this in the campaign result class - my $contributors_rs = $self->users( { 'me.status' => _cont_status_not_in(), 'me.deleted' => 0, 'me.hidden' => 0, }, $dbic_args );

13:14:23<&alnewkirk> hahahahaha
13:15:07<&MachinShin> hahahaha
13:15:10<&alnewkirk> it seems that those statuses are relevant on other objects
13:15:11<&ironcamel> so we need the lowest common denominator
13:15:29<&alnewkirk> ?
13:15:31<&ironcamel> which is what i think the existing cont_rset() method is
13:15:45<&ironcamel> it doesn't do the hidden => 0, for example
13:17:11<&ironcamel> the current cont_rset method is used in other places, because it is not too constraining
13:18:16<&ironcamel> it only does         { deleted => 0, status => _cont_status_not_in },

13:38:51[19:52:04] <&ironcamel       > i kinda like your way better
13:38:51[19:52:26] <&alnewkirk       > which kinda suggests that postauth_rejected, ???_rejected, etc could be returned also
13:38:51[19:52:40] <&ironcamel       > well, the reason that the cont_rset logic may still be correct
13:38:51[19:52:50] <&ironcamel       > is if those status are no longer valid statuses
13:38:51[19:53:00] <&ironcamel       > we used to have a different payment processor, called poundpay
13:38:51[19:53:09] <&ironcamel       > and some of the status we used then, we no longer use
13:38:51[19:53:17] <&alnewkirk       > ... not to mention, a status of preauth_accepted, seems valid in the query I'm trtying to construct
13:38:51[19:53:35] <&ironcamel       > again, preauth_accepted does not exist anymore i believe
13:38:51[19:53:44] <&ironcamel       > it is not even in that hash map that you pasted
13:38:51[19:53:52] <&alnewkirk       > is there a master list of possible statuses?

13:38:51[19:54:06] <&ironcamel       > select distinct status from contributions;
13:38:51[19:54:07] <&alnewkirk       > but it is in the cont_rset criteria
13:38:51[19:54:23] <&ironcamel       > yeah
13:38:51[19:54:41] <&alnewkirk       > ironcamel: that just shows whats in the database at the time, not what possibilities there are
13:38:51[19:54:50] <&ironcamel       > yeah
13:38:51[19:54:59] <&ironcamel       > i don't know what the current possibilities are
13:38:51[19:55:09] <&ironcamel       > not at the time

13:38:51[19:55:17] <&ironcamel       > it shows the possibilities of all time
13:38:51[19:55:22] <&alnewkirk       > seemed valid at the time
13:38:51[19:55:28] <&ironcamel       > right
13:38:51[19:55:35] <&ironcamel       > so the best way to do it is to centralize the logic
13:38:51[19:55:40] <&ironcamel       > and use existing logic
13:38:51[19:55:42] <&StoneCypher     > you know what else seemed valid at the time?  disco.
13:38:51[19:55:43] <&alnewkirk       > well ... maybe, if run against the production database
13:38:51[19:55:44] <&ironcamel       > instead of creating new logic

13:38:51[19:57:22] <&ironcamel       > throughnothing: my concern is that it is different than the logic cont_rset() uses

13:49:44<&throughnothing> alnewkirk: i'll think about it ;)
13:50:27<&ironcamel> throughnothing, StoneCypher, for me it says the https://www.crowdtilt.com/users/cbaker85 guy is a member of 1 campaign, when i am not logged in
13:50:34<&ironcamel> when i log in, it says he is a member of 23 campaigns.
13:50:56<&throughnothing> for me it says 84
13:51:00<&throughnothing> i wonder if its pulling data for the logged in user
13:51:04<&throughnothing> rather than the user you are viewing
13:51:05<&ironcamel> it must be
13:51:17<&throughnothing> i have like 100+ though
13:51:20<&throughnothing> i should anyway
13:51:29<&throughnothing> ironcamel_mobile: if i view your profile, it says 84 also
13:51:30<&throughnothing> lol
13:51:33<&throughnothing> but 47 tilted
13:51:33<&MachinShin> i logged in, it see 1
13:51:36<&throughnothing> https://www.crowdtilt.com/users/nmassjouni
13:51:51<&ironcamel> i'm a member of 23 campaigns
13:51:58<&ironcamel> 47 tilted
13:52:06<&throughnothing> yeah
13:52:10<&throughnothing> so you see 23 on everyones page
13:52:15<&ironcamel> according to my profile page
13:52:15<&throughnothing> and i see 84
13:52:16<&throughnothing> on everyones
13:52:22<&ironcamel> yeahh
13:52:29<&ironcamel> thats a cool feature
13:52:36<&ironcamel> it makes you feel like everyone is equal to you
13:52:55<&throughnothing> yeah
13:52:57<&throughnothing> A+
13:53:02<&throughnothing> i had a branch a long time ago
13:53:05<&throughnothing> that added a /stats route to /users/:id
13:53:08<&throughnothing> to get that adta
13:53:12<&throughnothing> rather than building it horribly on the frontend like we do now
13:53:15<&throughnothing> maybe i should revive that
13:53:19<&throughnothing> that is so much simpler
13:53:46<&ironcamel> how do they calculate it now?
13:53:58<&throughnothing> by iterating over the campaigns from eth list
13:54:01<&throughnothing> on the frontend
13:54:04<&throughnothing> and doing all the math itself
13:54:11<&throughnothing> the profile page and corresponding api routes
13:54:11<&ironcamel> haha
13:54:15<&throughnothing> are the worst things in our whole system
13:54:17<&throughnothing> lol
13:54:22<&MachinShin> lol. ouch
13:54:30<&ironcamel> that sounds like something you would do
13:54:39<&MachinShin> i bet the mobile guys would prefer a /stats route there too.. 
13:54:56<&throughnothing> anyone who doesn't like pain and stabbing themselves would
13:55:00<&throughnothing> :)
13:55:40<&dsog> throughnothing: what about people that like stabbing other people?

15:23:26<&dsog> ironcamel_mobile: how do you feel when mac users teach you something about PCs?
15:23:29<&throughnothing> so that u can get more than 2 hours of battery life with linux
15:23:29<&dsog> lol
15:23:36<&dsog> throughnothing: haha
15:23:36<&throughnothing> :P
15:23:40<&ironcamel> dsog: you got me there :)
15:23:48<&throughnothing> dsog: the state of scheduling + power management in open source is just so awful its depressing :'(
15:24:01<&dsog> throughnothing: The state of open source is depressing :P
15:24:02<&ironcamel> throughnothing: send linus a patch
15:24:18<&dsog> ironcamel_mobile: You should just copy the code that Apple open sources and send it to linus.
15:24:21<&throughnothing> ironcamel_mobile: everytime i send him a patch i get a bag of shit mailed to me
15:24:26<&throughnothing> and its on fire
15:24:28<&dsog> throughnothing: haha
15:24:29<&ironcamel> you get what you give
15:24:33<&throughnothing> and it has a recording of linus yelling at me
15:24:38<&throughnothing> ironcamel_mobile: that's what she said
15:25:18<&StoneCypher> throughnothing: lol did he really?
15:25:30<&throughnothing> StoneCypher: no, i may have just dreamed all of that
15:25:41<&MachinShin> but it's totally believable :) 
15:25:47<&StoneCypher> it is.
15:25:56<&castral> i think the last guy who tried to update the linux scheduler did practically get a flaming bag of shit

15:26:27<&throughnothing> to try stuff out before it got into mainline
15:26:30<&StoneCypher> THE LOUIS KERNELS
15:26:36<&throughnothing> then i realized i was wasting years of my life when it had already been solved by aaple ;)
15:26:40<&castral> hehe
15:26:42<&StoneCypher> "solved"
15:26:44<&throughnothing> lol
15:26:46<&dsog> throughnothing: exactly
15:26:48<&StoneCypher> by using bsd
15:26:52<&StoneCypher> and other peoples' work
15:27:01<&dsog> There is no harm in that.
15:27:02<&throughnothing> if you run bsd
15:27:08<&throughnothing> your scheduler still sucks compared to os X
15:27:10<&dsog> They give back to the community .. the kernel is open source.
15:27:14<&StoneCypher> throughnothing: how so

15:28:28<&castral> throughnothing: have you messed with debian/hurt before?
15:28:36<&StoneCypher> throughnothing: that "update" is just some guy speaking his opinion
15:28:49<&ironcamel> alnewkirk: i explained the problem in a comment on your PR
15:28:53<&throughnothing> castral: no, its the kinda thing that i *love* in theory
15:28:57<&alnewkirk> (looking now)
15:28:59<&throughnothing> and want to support
15:29:02<&throughnothing> but its so far behind its ridiculous
15:29:06<&throughnothing> same with gnustep, like i was saying earlier
15:29:19<&Forest Belton> microsoft's singularity tackled the performance issues of all the context switches associated with a microkernel
15:29:20<&throughnothing> i think ur better off working on freebsd or something
15:29:22<&Forest Belton> but afaik that went basically nowhere

15:29:39<&ironcamel> cool
15:29:40<&throughnothing> Forest Belton: the whole team got swallowed up into the singularity and were never seen again
15:29:42<&StoneCypher> yeah, singularity was beautiful, but they didn't want to make it work with backwards compat
15:29:43<&throughnothing> just like most microsoft products
15:29:45<&Forest Belton> haha
15:29:51<&StoneCypher> it's a real shame

15:30:05<&StoneCypher> lol no
15:30:06<&throughnothing> castral: YES
15:30:20<&throughnothing> its depressing that that exists
15:30:24<&Forest Belton> coyotos > menuet
15:30:30<&StoneCypher> it's been 14 years and he hasn't hit version 1 yet
15:30:34<&StoneCypher> might as well just use contiki
15:30:34<&MachinShin> is that the one w/ the C-style commandline langauge
15:30:37<&castral> lol are we really going to compare whose asm OS is better?
15:30:46<&Forest Belton> coyotos isn't written in ASM :P
15:30:50<&StoneCypher> "with resolutions up to 1920x1080" lolololol
15:30:53<&castral> oh, then it automatically sucks

15:30:55<&MachinShin> Forest Belton: haskell? 
15:31:03<&Forest Belton> nah, bitc
15:31:14<&throughnothing> my favorite has to be the java OS

16:14:14<&DelvarWorld> hey man i had phantom unit tests and everything
16:14:17<&throughnothing> DelvarWorld: do you think theer's any value in rainforest for usL
16:14:18<&throughnothing> ?
16:14:23<&DelvarWorld> throughnothing:  nope
16:14:26<&throughnothing> they have been bugging me again about helping us to use them i we want
16:14:34<&throughnothing> it could be valuable for designers to write logical tests for new features?
16:14:35<&StoneCypher> man i actually really like phantom as a test platform (also rhino)
16:14:36<&throughnothing> that then get auto tested
16:14:40<&DelvarWorld> we haven't done anything with in the many months that we've known about them
16:14:48<&throughnothing> kz was working on using them
16:14:52<&throughnothing> he had done a little bit
16:14:54<&Forest Belton> phantom starts becoming super unwieldy once you start doing anything nontrivial
16:15:10<&StoneCypher> rhino's even worse; it's not just headless, but also conceptually headless
16:15:15<&throughnothing> Forest Belton: just like anything else for browser testing?
16:15:19<&Forest Belton> :(
16:15:25<&throughnothing> Forest Belton: are you saying selenium is better in that regard?
16:15:25<&StoneCypher> but you know, i got phantom to cover quite a bit, personally
16:15:28<&throughnothing> or any tool you know of? heh
16:15:35<&MachinShin> so the easy stuff if easy, and the hard stuff if impossible? ;)

16:37:19<&fang> this campaign image is about 100px

16:38:35<&throughnothing> fang: https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/cWi3IK2rTei99XdTNc00
16:38:37<&throughnothing> thats the original

16:38:47<&fang> i mean the campaign image
16:38:50<&throughnothing> oh
16:39:09<&throughnothing> yeah, its easy to get around by just changing the client side javascript
16:39:15<&throughnothing> they probably just did that since its defcon LOL
16:39:27<&throughnothing> but probably not, we can look intoit
16:39:29<&fang> can we double check
16:39:31<&fang> thx

10:48:38<&StoneCypher> throughnothing: kay :)
10:49:49<&StoneCypher> throughnothing: you did not re 1209.  basically, andy and i talked about it a week or two ago, and we're removing the old bad fix so that i can re-do it correctly.  since it's around browser bug behavior, i have to go see which pages are affected to fix them.  the old fix is roughly correct but is incorrectly placed, and when it's placed somewhere unaffected it causes problems of its own.
10:49:58<&StoneCypher> throughnothing: the "re-break" is already merged
10:50:05<&StoneCypher> throughnothing: the fix will go out as soon as the re-break goes out

11:27:21<&msaint> so
11:27:25<&msaint> deep question for the group
11:27:33<&msaint> do you guys think when Crowdtilt goes interstellar, we'll need to migrate from GUIDs to UUIDs?
11:27:45<&ironcamel> i thought those were the same thing
11:27:59<&msaint> haha I think they are
11:28:26<&ironcamel> trick question
11:28:28<&msaint> but, you know, global could just be planet earth
11:28:29<&MachinShin> what if we launch a crowdtilt.mars? then the identifiers will no longer be unique! ;) 
11:28:38<&msaint> while universal encompasses so much more

11:29:59<&throughnothing> ironcamel_mobile: what about HUID's

11:30:11<&ironcamel> that's racist
11:30:25<&castral> what about alternate universes?

11:32:30<&StoneCypher> msaint: they're not significantly different

11:46:42<&StoneCypher> ironcamel: when the universe collapses into a single ball under its own weight after the heat death, can we go back to guids?
11:47:03<&ironcamel> it won't matter then, will it?
11:47:13<&StoneCypher> I WILL SURVIVE AND SO WILL CROWDTILT SO YES
11:47:43<&ironcamel> then you will get to choose anything you like
11:47:48<&MachinShin> alnewkirk: i incorporated all the requested changes from the reviews from e17b4f0 into 00fe705. so that includes your deletes of Crowdtilt.pm, cpanfile, and whatever. if you've reviewd it since, there shouldn't be any significant changes
