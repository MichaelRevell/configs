13:31:31michael.revell   oh sweet
13:31:38<vat.raghavan@cro> ? 
13:31:52michael.revell   I just noticed your alias instructions
13:31:59<vat.raghavan@cro> ah
13:32:07michael.revell   I feel like irssi should ping me when I get an update
13:32:14<vat.raghavan@cro> btw, i found a bug in my config. you should change /set awl_maxlines 2
13:32:53michael.revell   where do i set that at?
13:33:05michael.revell   nvm
13:33:06michael.revell   i see it
13:33:10michael.revell   why 2?
13:33:21michael.revell   boom. changed.
13:33:23michael.revell   like a boss
13:33:32<vat.raghavan@cro> cause atm it's 1, and if you have more than a certain # of windows, it doesn't set a scrollbar, or tell you that there aer more offscreen windows.
