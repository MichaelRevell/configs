13:31:31michael.revell   oh sweet
13:31:38<vat.raghavan@cro> ? 
13:31:52michael.revell   I just noticed your alias instructions
13:31:59<vat.raghavan@cro> ah
13:32:07michael.revell   I feel like irssi should ping me when I get an update
13:32:14<vat.raghavan@cro> btw, i found a bug in my config. you should change /set awl_maxlines 2
13:32:53michael.revell   where do i set that at?
13:33:05michael.revell   nvm
13:33:06michael.revell   i see it
13:33:10michael.revell   why 2?
13:33:21michael.revell   boom. changed.
13:33:23michael.revell   like a boss
13:33:32<vat.raghavan@cro> cause atm it's 1, and if you have more than a certain # of windows, it doesn't set a scrollbar, or tell you that there aer more offscreen windows.

14:19:10cc<;/vat.raghavan@crog> ehe doesn't use labels i thought. he said he just has everythign in inbox and searches

14:21:36cc</michael.revell  g ealso I just found out that you can execute commands with :exec in mutt

14:21:52cc</michael.revell  g ewas confusing me

14:23:52cc<;/vat.raghavan@crog> ei decided i'm gonna write a simple script so irssi can either get my passwords from my ssh-keys or from the keygen. cause as it stands it's stupid. the solution in #irssi is to either lockdown my confi so only i can read it.. or "go fuck yourself". 
14:25:58cc</michael.revell  g eyes do that!
14:26:11cc</michael.revell  g ealso this might help get you started for the mac key chain

14:46:14cc<;/vat.raghavan@crog> eyah. i'm looking into seeing if irssi has a on-server-connect event. or something, so i can 'inject' the password from my secure source
14:46:56cc</michael.revell  g ealso you could always do it from a tmux.config

14:48:18cc</michael.revell  g eyou can do a tmux send-keys "/connect vat `secureity blah blah blah vat@crowdtilt.com`"
14:48:32cc<;/vat.raghavan@crog> eoh. good lord. that'd be .. ugh
14:48:40cc</michael.revell  g ehahahaha
14:48:46cc</michael.revell  g ei do that for /nicklist fifo
14:48:56cc</michael.revell  g eso I don't have to set that up when i open up tmux
14:49:06cc</michael.revell  g etmux send-keys 'cat ~/.irssi/nicklistfifo' 'Enter'
14:49:26cc</michael.revell  g etmux send-keys 'cat ~/.irssi/nicklistfifo' 'Enter'
14:49:47cc</michael.revell  g eand then in irssi i send this

14:49:48cc</michael.revell  g etmux send-keys '/nicklist fifo' 'Enter'

14:50:02cc<;/vat.raghavan@crog> erather i do that now.. 
14:50:59cc</michael.revell  g eI actually kind of like doing a bash script for setting up tmux. it ends up being about the same amount of lines and you get way more control
