I could set it up manually in alsa but that does not work in a desirable manner, One program can steal the sound and would need to be closed in order for another to get sound.
2013-07-06 14:20:46	[R]	then you are breaking alsa
2013-07-06 14:20:58	[R]	because alsa has supported software mixing and its been turned on by default for years

2013-07-06 20:39:42	GeorgeTorwell	just that there is no point to keep fracturing the community further and further. Everyone should get around wayland and support it as the future of X, instead of tryign to make a million alternatives
2013-07-06 20:39:44	Bloodhound	then whatswrong with those who want to choose Mir over wayland?
2013-07-06 20:40:02	GeorgeTorwell	because they are reinventing something that already exists instead of making what already exists better

2013-07-06 21:02:14	DLange	surial: it means that the sequence of files will not be the same in the copied directory (i.e. sequence of files are "sorted" differently). Usually this is not of any concern to folks usings cp, but better said than sorry.

2013-07-08 18:08:41	ultra	and instead of having no network quality archive, I'd rather put something even if very simple and self made in place, so that I could spend some time learning how to properly configure a complex off the shelf solutiion

2013-07-08 18:29:42	ananke	blckpythn: depends on what you want to achieve. PXE in general is fairly easy, it's simply a combination of DHCP and TFTP
2013-07-08 18:29:43	ultra	<ananke> ultra: so you're talking about performing a transfer between _two_ systems using more than _one_ concurrenct connections?
2013-07-08 18:29:44	ultra	yes
2013-07-08 18:29:45	ultra	i am
2013-07-08 18:30:12	ultra	and if there was another question, i can't find it, i only see myself being highlighted for not following along well enough.
2013-07-08 18:30:19	ananke	ultra: and you seem to refer to curl/axel, which implies you're talking about HTTP?
2013-07-08 18:30:27	blckpythn	ananke: sort of looking for a WDS alternative, or maybe just boot to iso for rescue purposes.
2013-07-08 18:30:33	ultra	ananke, I was referring to them in a more abstard way
2013-07-08 18:30:57	ultra	not in a technical manner, but in a general 'functional' sense
2013-07-08 18:31:29	blckpythn	I know of FOG but I've had nothing but trouble when trying to make a non-fixed partition image
2013-07-08 18:31:31	ananke	blckpythn: pxe can be used for a lot of tasks. for actual deployment of linux systems, a lot of distros have their own solutions. pxe is really just about booting things over the network
2013-07-08 18:31:46	ultra	i just want to exploit the same principle that 'download accelerators' use, to also increase the performance of any type of upload
2013-07-08 18:32:13	ananke	ultra: to talk about 'same principle' we must know what protocols you're talking about
2013-07-08 18:32:32	rypervenche	ultra: Are you looking to simply transfer a text file from one server to another?
2013-07-08 18:32:34	ananke	ultra: and likely we'll arrive at my earlier statement: POST methods in HTTP do not allow for it

2013-07-08 18:32:59	blckpythn	ananke: I'm very familiar with what PXE is, just haven't tried building anything PXE related other than a WDS server and FOG

2013-07-08 18:38:10	ananke	the 'principle' behind said 'download accelerators' is simply a workaround of artificial limitations put in place on purpose. if you control both sides, and have non-residential ISP connection, you will unlikely see a significant difference in speed

2013-07-08 18:44:33	ananke	i'm not sure i'd qualify clonezilla as a deployment technology. it's really meant for restoring of static images of already configured systems

2013-07-08 18:45:39	ananke	it all depends on what your ultimate goal is: manage a computer lab with identical machines, or deploy workstations/servers that will be customized

2013-07-08 23:39:30	i336_	*sigh*... I think I've tried to bite off more than I can chew here. I'm trying to find some kind of library that will let me essentially screen-scrape a VT100 display so I can get at the data. I first thought I'd hack together a little script in PHP (which I kind of use like another person might use Perl) but found that, on this laptop here, it took 15 seconds to process 15KB of data (think a 100x50 fullscreen mc display).
2013-07-08 23:39:52	i336_	so then I tried freebasic, set up a simple benchmark and it seems really slow too.
2013-07-08 23:40:39	i336_	so I've gotten the point; not only should I not write my own, I should probably be using C, since this 333MHz laptop isn't the only place I might be running this - I might be running it on a ~100-300MHz ARM chip at some point too.
2013-07-08 23:41:07	i336_	thing is, I can't really find anything that is specifically designed to "just interpret vt100 escape sequences"
2013-07-08 23:41:22	HelenaKitty	30 hours :(
2013-07-08 23:41:27	i336_	O.o!
2013-07-08 23:41:42	i336_	I'm handling the connecting (I'm using dtach and reading from that, since that means if my control program crashes the apps still stay alive :P), so I don't want terminal/pty handling
2013-07-08 23:41:59	HelenaKitty	that sounds like a lot buts it's just a couple of days
2013-07-08 23:42:03	i336_	true
2013-07-08 23:42:09	i336_	what makes me feel silly is that both 'script' (part of util-linux-ng) and dvtm incorporate little vt100 parsers
2013-07-08 23:42:15	i336_	but I can't work out where they begin or end

2013-07-09 19:28:36	i336_	hi... I'm trying to find a bluetooth dongle on ebay for a system running kernel 2.6.27.7 (which supports the BCM203x and BPA10x series chipsets), which is proving really hard because nobody is talking about chipset information. I'm reading that bluetooth on linux "just works", but is this the case for 2.6.27.7?

2013-07-09 19:29:09	i336_	also, if I understand correctly BT 3.0 came out in 2009, and 2.6.27.7 came out in 2008, so it will probably only support BT 2.0 or 2.1 at the latest, right?
2013-07-09 19:29:27	DLange	AlbinoGeek: no idea what you are doing that is needs to handle ICMP. Care to enlighten us that what the technical case you're solving there is?

2013-07-10 10:31:30	causasui	I don't see that as so black and white... there must be ways to mitigate the damage. fwiw I don't think valve is actually malicious or willing to search for exploits like that to root my system, but I do think they might be doing some things that are lazy and I would like to put some brakes on the process in the spirit of the principle of least privilege
2013-07-10 10:31:31	Walex	causasui: they are gigantic binary blobs that do extremely complicated kernel level stuff with enormous opportunities for bugs, and they are developed in a hurry and released without that much testing.

2013-07-10 13:08:13	latenite	Hi folks, is there a real reason why LTO-4 5 6 streamers are THAT expensive >1000$  ? How different are they from a 20$ dvd drive? Its a stepper motor in a plastic enlosure. Or am I overlooking something here?
2013-07-10 13:08:24	Walex	CipherWizard: it is just a complicated, subtle thing.

2013-07-10 13:09:18	Walex	CipherWizard: there are two types of automounters: those triggered by events, like dbus mounting and those triggered by access like 'autofs'. The latter are the best.

2013-07-10 13:10:32	Walex	CipherWizard: instead 'autofs' and 'amd-utils' mount when one tries to access, and then umount automantically after a timeout, so most of the time the stuff stays unmounted and gets mounted only on request.

2013-07-10 13:11:21	Walex	CipherWizard: but then after using both 'autofs' or 'amd-utils' I just use a verbose '/etc/fstab' where I have pre-written all the likely mount points and options.

2013-07-10 13:11:49	Bloodhound	but*
2013-07-10 13:11:53	Walex	because recent 'mount' commands look up a n 'fstab' line given a mount point, so one can mount with different options by specifying differen tmount points.
